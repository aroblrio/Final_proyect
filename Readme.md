# The Super Calculator

In this proyect, I did a three-in-one calculator. It is composed of three parts, the first one is a basic calculator like those you find in your mobile phone, the second, is a statistic calculator and the third one lets you draw polynomial functions and represents them in a graph.

## Installation

In order to run the programm, you need to open the ``Ultra_Calculator.py´´ file and then click on the three dots to download the raw file. When you are finshed with the installation, open Visual Studio Code and press Ctrl + O in order to open the file. Once you haver opened it you can click on F5 to run the programm.

## The calculator 

The first part is a calculator with basic operations like adding, square roots or trigonometrical functions.
In the second part, you need to import an excel file with data from a poblation and it tells you some data, such as the average, the median or the typical deviation. Note: All the data must be in the first column, otherwise the programm wont recognize the data.
In the third part you can write a function and the programm will generate a graph of it. Note: It only works with polynomial functions.

In order to access all this functions, you need to click on the menu button on the upper left corner.
